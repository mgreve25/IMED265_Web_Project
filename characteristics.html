        <p class="boxed"> Screamo is a style of hardcore punk-influenced emo
          with screaming. Alex Henderson of AllMusic considers screamo a
          bridge between hardcore punk and emo. The term screamo is a
          portmanteau of the words "scream" and "emo." Screamo uses typical rock
          instrumentation, but is notable for its brief compositions, chaotic
          sounds, harmonized guitars, and screaming vocals. Screamo is
          characterized "by frequent shifts in tempo and dynamics and by
          tension-and-release catharses." Many screamo bands also incorporate
          ballads. According to AllMusic, screamo is "generally based in the
          aggressive side of the overarching punk-revival scene." Screamed
          vocals are used "not consistently, but as a kind of crescendo element,
          a sonic weapon to be trotted out when the music and lyrics reach a
          particular emotional pitch." Emotional singing and harsh screaming
          are common vocals in screamo.</p>
        <p class="boxed"> Screamo lyrics often feature topics such as emotional
          pain, breakups, romantic interest, politics, and human rights.
          These lyrics are usually introspective, similar to that of softer emo
          bands. The New York Times noted that "part of the music's appeal is
          its un-self-conscious acceptance of differences, respect for
          otherness." Some screamo bands openly demonstrate acceptance of
          religious, nonreligious, and straight edge lifestyles</p>
        <p class="boxed"> Many screamo bands in the 1990s saw themselves as
          implicitly political, and as a reaction against the turn to the right
          embodied by California politicians, such as Roger Hedgecock. Some
          groups were also unusually theoretical in inspiration: Angel Hair
          cited surrealist writers Antonin Artaud and Georges Bataille, and
          Orchid lyrically name-checked French new wave icon Anna Karina, German
          philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, French philosopher Michel Foucault,
          and critical theory originators the Frankfurt School.</p>
