        <p class="boxed"> While the genre was developing in the early 1990s, it
          was not initially called "screamo." Chris Taylor, lead vocalist for
          the band Pg. 99, said "we never liked that whole screamo thing. Even
          during our existence, we tried to venture away from the fashion and
          tell people, 'Hey, this is punk.'" Jonathan Dee of The New York
          Times wrote that the term "tends to bring a scornful laugh from the
          bands themselves." Lars Gotrich of NPR Music made the following
          comment on the matter in 2011:</p>
        <p class="boxed"> The screamo scene has changed a lot in the last 10
          years. There used to be more creative bands like Circle Takes the
          Square and City of Caterpillar. And then it took this route where
          screamo got really streamlined and unrecognizable to the point where
          someone hilariously invented the term skramz to distinguish the first
          wave of screamo bands.</p>
        <p class="boxed">In the 2000s, the term "screamo" began being used
          loosely to describe any use of human vocal instrument growled-word
          vocals (commonly termed screamed vocals) in music. It has been
          applied to a wide variety of genres unrelated to the original screamo
          scene. Juan Gabe, vocalist for the band Comadre, alleged that the
          term "has been kind of tainted in a way, especially in the
          States." Derek Miller, guitarist for the band Poison the Well,
          noted the term's constant differing usages and jokingly stated that it
          "describes a thousand different genres." Bert McCracken, lead
          singer of The Used, stated that screamo is merely a term "for record
          companies to sell records and for record stores to categorize
          them."</p>
