        <h2> Origins (1990s) </h2>
        <p class="boxed"> Around 1990 and 1991, a number of bands began pushing the sound of early
          emo into more extreme and chaotic territory. The earliest of these acts
          were New Jersey's Iconoclast and Merel, however the most influential acts
          were those from San Diego and signed to Gravity Records.[12] In
          particular, Heroin are the band generally cited as either pioneering
          screamo or being the band that inspired the earliest acts in the
          genre,[12][13][14] with other notable bands from the city, including Angel
          Hair, Antioch Arrow and Swing Kids.[14] These early San Diego screamo
          bands were sometimes called "spock rock" by fans due to many of them
          dyeing their hair black and cutting straight fringes similar to the Star
          Trek character Spock. This, in combination with their geek-chic style of
          dressing would prove particularly influential on the development of the
          subsequent emo and scene subcultures.[15]</p>
        <p class="boxed"> In New Jersey, the genre continued to grow, soon expanding into New York
          City. Native Nod, Rye Coalition, 1.6 Band, Rorschach and Mohinder all
          became prominent in this scene, which was centred around ABC No Rio, [16]
          while the sound expanded to elsewhere in the United States with Universal
          Order of Armageddon (from Baltimore) and Mohinder (from Cupertino,
          California). [17] In San Francisco, Portraits of Past were one of the
          earliest groups to merge the primitive screamo sound with post-rock, a
          combination that Funeral Diner would then continue, while also embracing
          the influence of black metal.[14]</p>
        <p class="boxed"> At the same time, many bands in the southern United States began pushing
          the early screamo sound even further sonically. Columbia, South Carolina
          band In/Humanity coined the term "emoviolence" to describe this sound,
          played by them, as well as Florida bands Palatka and the End of the
          Century Party. When coined, the term was a tongue in cheek portmanteau of
          "emo" and "powerviolence", two genre descriptions the members of
          In/Humanity maligned, as well as a reference to the album Emotional
          Violence by funk band Cameo, however as subsequent bands took influence
          from the sound of these groups, the term became increasingly
          widespread.[18][19]</p>
        <p class="boxed"> Towards the end of the 1990s and into the 2000s, Virginia developed a
          large and influential screamo scene: Pg. 99, who continued in the extreme
          and chaotic screamo sound; City of Caterpillar, who were one of the most
          influential early bands to merge screamo with post-rock; Majority Rule who
          merged the genre with metalcore; and Malady who merged post-inflected
          screamo with indie rock. All of which released albums which BrooklynVegan
          writer Andrew Sacher called essential albums in the genre.[14] One of the
          most influential bands to come from the New York City screamo scene was
          Saetia, who formed in 1997 and created a sound influenced by math rock,
          jazz and Midwest emo. Following Saetia's 1999 disbandment, its members
          formed the similarly influential bands Off Minor and Hot Cross. Other
          impactful groups in the genre at this time included Jeromes Dream, Neil
          Perry, I Hate Myself, Reversal of Man, Yaphet Kotto and Orchid.[14]</p>

        <h2> Revival (2010s) </h2>
        <p class="boxed"> In the early 2010s the term "screamo" began to be largely reclaimed by a
          new crop of do-it-yourself bands, with many screamo acts, like Loma
          Prieta, Pianos Become the Teeth, La Dispute, and Touché Amoré releasing
          records on fairly large independent labels such as Deathwish Inc.[28] In
          2011 Alternative Press noted that La Dispute is "at the forefront of a
          traditional-screamo revival" for their critically acclaimed release
          Wildlife.[29] They are a part of a group of stylistically similar
          screamo-revival bands self-defined as "The Wave," made up of Touché Amoré,
          La Dispute, Defeater, Pianos Become the Teeth, and Make Do and
          Mend.[30][31] As well as, California's Deafheaven, who formed in 2010,
          having been described as screamo, in a style similar to that of Envy.[32]
          Alternative Press has cited a "pop screamo revival" along with this, with
          bands like Before Their Eyes, the Ongoing Concept, Too Close to Touch and
          I Am Terrified.[33]</p>
        <p class="boxed"> In August 2018, Noisey writer Dan Ozzi declared that it was the "Summer
          of Screamo" in a month-long series documenting screamo acts pushing the
          genre forward following the decline in popularity of "The Wave," as well
          as the reunions of seminal bands such as Pg. 99, Majority Rule, City of
          Caterpillar,[34] and Jeromes Dream.[35] Groups highlighted in this
          coverage, including Respire,[36][37] Ostraca,[38] Portrayal of
          Guilt,[39][40][41] Soul Glo,[42] I Hate Sex,[43] and Infant
          Island,[44][45][46] had generally received positive press from large
          publications, but were not as widely successful as their predecessors.
          Noisey also documented that, despite its loss of mainstream popularity and
          continued hold in North American scenes, particularly Richmond,
          Virginia,[47] screamo had become a more international movement; notably
          spreading to Japan, France, and Sweden with groups including Heaven in Her
          Arms, Birds in Row and Suis La Lune, respectively.[48] Also in 2018, Vein
          released their debut album Errorzone to critical acclaim and commercial
          success, bringing together elements of screamo, hardcore, and nu
          metal.[49][50][51] This underground cohort of acts was primarily released
          by independent labels like Middle-Man Records[52] in the United States,
          Zegema Beach Records[53] in Canada, and Miss The Stars Records in
          Berlin.[54]</p>

        <h2> Mainstream crossover (2000s) </h2>
        <p class="boxed"> By 1995, the term "screamo" drifted into the music press, especially in
          the journalism of Jim DeRogatis and Andy Greenwald.[4] Following the
          release of their 2001 album Full Collapse, New Jersey's Thursday were the
          first screamo–influenced band to gain significant media attention.[20] The
          following year, saw the release of Canada's Alexisonfire's self-titled
          album, which Metal Hammer writer Matt Mills called "key in legitimising
          the screamo sound".[21] In the following years, the Used, Thrice, Finch
          and Silverstein all gained significant attention for furthering this
          sound.[3][8] In contrast to the do-it-yourself screamo bands of the 1990s,
          screamo bands such as Thursday and the Used signed multi-album contracts
          with labels such as Island Def Jam and Reprise Records.[22] However, this
          style's connection to the genre has been disputed, with some referring to
          it as "MTV screamo"[1] or "pop-screamo", and many bands more commonly
          being categorized as post-hardcore or metalcore.[23]</p>
        <p class="boxed"> In the underground screamo scene, post-rock became an increasingly
          prominent influence amongst bands. The most prominent and influential of
          these acts was Richmond, Virginia's City of Caterpillar,[14] who Vice
          writer Jason Heller stated "encompass [the] era".[24] Music critics coined
          the term "post-screamo" to refer to this sound.[25][26] Other prominent
          acts making this sound at the time included Circle Takes the Square,
          Raein, Envy and Daïtro.[14] Fluff Fest, held in Czechia since 2000, was in
          2017 described by Bandcamp Daily as a "summer ritual" for many fans of
          screamo in Europe.[27]</p>
