        <h2> Emoviolence</h2>
        <p> Some screamo bands borrow the extreme dissonance, speed, and chaos
          of powerviolence. As a result, the term emoviolence was half-jokingly
          coined by the band In/Humanity to describe the fusion of the two
          styles which applied to themselves, as well as other bands including
          Pg. 99, Orchid, Reversal of Man, Usurp Synapse, and RentAmerica.
          Additionally, bands such as Orchid, Reversal of Man, and Circle Takes
          the Square tend to be much closer in style to grindcore than their
          forebears. In contemporary times, the genre is no longer as prevalent
          or widespread as it had been in the past, yet it still remains as a
          notable and prevalent force in underground screamo. A revival of the
          genre has occurred internationally with regional scenes in Southeast
          Asia and South America taking prominence.</p>
        <h2> Sass</h2>
        <p> Sass (also known as white belt hardcore, sassy screamo or dancey
          screamo) is a style that emerged from the late-1990s and
          early-2000s screamo scene. The genre incorporates elements of
          post-punk, new wave, disco, electronic, dance-punk, grindcore,
          noise rock, metalcore, mathcore and beatdown hardcore. The genre is
          characterized by overtly flamboyant mannerisms, homoerotic lyrical
          content, synthesizers, dance beats and a lisping vocal style. Sass
          bands include the Blood Brothers, An Albatross, The Number Twelve
          Looks Like You, the Plot to Blow Up the Eiffel Tower, early Daughters,
          later-Orchid and SeeYouSpaceCowboy.</p>

        <h2> Post-screamo</h2>
        <p> Bands including City of Caterpillar, Circle Takes the Square, Envy,
          Funeral Diner, Pianos Become the Teeth, Respire, and Le Pré Où
          Je Suis Mort have incorporated post-rock elements into their
          music. This fusion is characterized by abrupt changes in pace,
          atmospheric and harmonic instrumentation, and distorted
          vocals. Similarly, bands such as Heaven in Her Arms and the
          aforementioned group Envy, use elements of shoegazing.</p>
        <h2> Pop screamo</h2>
        <p> "Pop screamo" and "MTV screamo" are terms used to describe screamo
          influenced bands who use metallic instrumentation and pop song
          structure to form a more commercially viable sound than traditional
          screamo. The style developed and gained mainstream success in the
          early-2000s. The scene was led by bands such as Thursday,
          Hawthorne Heights, Taking Back Sunday, The Used, Senses Fail,
          Silverstein, Chiodos, From First to Last, Saosin, Thrice and Finch
          and now-defunct less-known bands such as Before Their Eyes, Here I
          Come Falling, Agraceful, Yesterdays Rising, Chasing Victory, Beloved,
          Dead Poetic, Burden of a Day and Sever Your Ties. The genre had a
          revival in the 2010s, including such outfits as Before Their Eyes, The
          Ongoing Concept, Too Close to Touch, I Am Terrified. Alternative
          Press describes pop screamo as "metal-influenced riffs and aggressive,
          high-end screams filled song's verses, while soaring melodies carried
          choruses to new, previously unattained heights." as well as "Poppy
          emo music with screaming in it that captured mainstream attention in
          the mid-2000s". Furthermore, many of these groups are more
          commonly categorized as, and influenced by, post-hardcore or
          metalcore.</p>
