        <h2> Emoviolence</h2>
        <p> Some screamo bands borrow the extreme dissonance, speed, and chaos of
        powerviolence. As a result, the term emoviolence was half-jokingly coined
        by the band In/Humanity to describe the fusion of the two styles which
        applied to themselves, as well as other bands including Pg. 99, Orchid,
        Reversal of Man, Usurp Synapse, and RentAmerica. Additionally, bands such
        as Orchid, Reversal of Man, and Circle Takes the Square tend to be much
        closer in style to grindcore than their forebears. In contemporary times,
        the genre is no longer as prevalent or widespread as it had been in the
        past, yet it still remains as a notable and prevalent force in underground
        screamo. A revival of the genre has occurred internationally with regional
        scenes in Southeast Asia and South America taking prominence.</p>
        <h2> Sass</h2>
      	<p> Sass (also known as white belt hardcore,[75] sassy screamo or dancey
        screamo)[76] is a style that emerged from the late-1990s and early-2000s
        screamo scene.[77] The genre incorporates elements of post-punk, new wave,
        disco, electronic, dance-punk,[77] grindcore, noise rock, metalcore,
        mathcore and beatdown hardcore. The genre is characterized by overtly
        flamboyant mannerisms, homoerotic lyrical content, synthesizers, dance
        beats and a lisping vocal style.[78] Sass bands include the Blood
        Brothers, An Albatross, The Number Twelve Looks Like You, the Plot to Blow
        Up the Eiffel Tower, early Daughters, later-Orchid[79][80] and
        SeeYouSpaceCowboy.[81]</p>

        <h2> Post-screamo</h2>
      	<p> Bands including City of Caterpillar, Circle Takes the Square, Envy,
        Funeral Diner, Pianos Become the Teeth,[69] Respire,[70] and Le Pré Où Je
        Suis Mort[71][72] have incorporated post-rock elements into their music.
        This fusion is characterized by abrupt changes in pace, atmospheric and
        harmonic instrumentation, and distorted vocals.[72][73] Similarly, bands
        such as Heaven in Her Arms and the aforementioned group Envy, use elements
        of shoegazing.[74]</p>
        <h2> Pop screamo</h2>
      	<p> "Pop screamo" and "MTV screamo" are terms used to describe screamo
        influenced bands who use metallic instrumentation and pop song structure
        to form a more commercially viable sound than traditional screamo. The
        style developed and gained mainstream success in the
        early-2000s.[23][1][82] The scene was led by bands such as Thursday,
        Hawthorne Heights, Taking Back Sunday, The Used,[83] Senses Fail,
        Silverstein, Chiodos, From First to Last, Saosin, Thrice and Finch[82] and
        now-defunct less-known bands such as Before Their Eyes, Here I Come
        Falling, Agraceful, Yesterdays Rising, Chasing Victory, Beloved, Dead
        Poetic, Burden of a Day and Sever Your Ties.[23] The genre had a revival
        in the 2010s, including such outfits as Before Their Eyes, The Ongoing
        Concept, Too Close to Touch, I Am Terrified.[33] Alternative Press
        describes pop screamo as "metal-influenced riffs and aggressive, high-end
        screams filled song's verses, while soaring melodies carried choruses to
        new, previously unattained heights."[23] as well as "Poppy emo music with
        screaming in it that captured mainstream attention in the mid-2000s".[82]
        Furthermore, many of these groups are more commonly categorized as, and
        influenced by, post-hardcore or metalcore.[23][84][1]</p>
