    <h1> Subgenres </h1>
    <h2> Emoviolence</h2>
    <p> Some screamo bands borrow the extreme dissonance, speed, and chaos of
      powerviolence. As a result, the term emoviolence was half-jokingly coined
      by the band In/Humanity to describe the fusion of the two styles which
      applied to themselves, as well as other bands including Pg. 99, Orchid,
      Reversal of Man, Usurp Synapse, and RentAmerica. Additionally, bands such
      as Orchid, Reversal of Man, and Circle Takes the Square tend to be much
      closer in style to grindcore than their forebears. In contemporary times,
      the genre is no longer as prevalent or widespread as it had been in the
      past, yet it still remains as a notable and prevalent force in underground
      screamo. A revival of the genre has occurred internationally with regional
      scenes in Southeast Asia and South America taking prominence.</p>
    <h2> Post-screamo</h2>
    <p> Bands including City of Caterpillar, Circle Takes the Square, Envy,
      Funeral Diner, Pianos Become the Teeth,[69] Respire,[70] and Le Pré Où Je
      Suis Mort[71][72] have incorporated post-rock elements into their music.
      This fusion is characterized by abrupt changes in pace, atmospheric and
      harmonic instrumentation, and distorted vocals.[72][73] Similarly, bands
      such as Heaven in Her Arms and the aforementioned group Envy, use elements
      of shoegazing.[74]</p>
    <h2> Sass</h2>
    <p> Sass (also known as white belt hardcore,[75] sassy screamo or dancey
      screamo)[76] is a style that emerged from the late-1990s and early-2000s
      screamo scene.[77] The genre incorporates elements of post-punk, new wave,
      disco, electronic, dance-punk,[77] grindcore, noise rock, metalcore,
      mathcore and beatdown hardcore. The genre is characterized by overtly
      flamboyant mannerisms, homoerotic lyrical content, synthesizers, dance
      beats and a lisping vocal style.[78] Sass bands include the Blood
      Brothers, An Albatross, The Number Twelve Looks Like You, the Plot to Blow
      Up the Eiffel Tower, early Daughters, later-Orchid[79][80] and
      SeeYouSpaceCowboy.[81]</p>
    <h2> Pop screamo</h2>
    <p> "Pop screamo" and "MTV screamo" are terms used to describe screamo
      influenced bands who use metallic instrumentation and pop song structure
      to form a more commercially viable sound than traditional screamo. The
      style developed and gained mainstream success in the
      early-2000s.[23][1][82] The scene was led by bands such as Thursday,
      Hawthorne Heights, Taking Back Sunday, The Used,[83] Senses Fail,
      Silverstein, Chiodos, From First to Last, Saosin, Thrice and Finch[82] and
      now-defunct less-known bands such as Before Their Eyes, Here I Come
      Falling, Agraceful, Yesterdays Rising, Chasing Victory, Beloved, Dead
      Poetic, Burden of a Day and Sever Your Ties.[23] The genre had a revival
      in the 2010s, including such outfits as Before Their Eyes, The Ongoing
      Concept, Too Close to Touch, I Am Terrified.[33] Alternative Press
      describes pop screamo as "metal-influenced riffs and aggressive, high-end
      screams filled song's verses, while soaring melodies carried choruses to
      new, previously unattained heights."[23] as well as "Poppy emo music with
      screaming in it that captured mainstream attention in the mid-2000s".[82]
      Furthermore, many of these groups are more commonly categorized as, and
      influenced by, post-hardcore or metalcore.[23][84][1]</p>
