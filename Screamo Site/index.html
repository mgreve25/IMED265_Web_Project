    <h1> Screamo </h1>
    <p class="boxed"> Screamo (also referred to as skramz) is an aggressive subgenre of emo
      that emerged in the early 1990s and emphasizes "willfully experimental
      dissonance and dynamics". San Diego-based bands Heroin and Antioch Arrow
      pioneered the genre in the early 1990s, and it was developed in the late
      1990s mainly by bands from the East Coast of the United States such as Pg.
      99, Orchid, Saetia, and I Hate Myself. Screamo is strongly influenced by
      hardcore punk and characterized by the use of screamed vocals. Lyrical
      themes usually include emotional pain, death, romance, and human rights.
      The term "screamo" has frequently been mistaken as referring to any music
      with screaming. </p>
